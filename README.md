<b>This repository contains the data files and scripts to reproduce the results in article "The possible copepod link between kelp forests, the pelagic ecosystem and deep-sea carbon sequestration" by Kristina Ø. Kvile, Marc Anglès d'Auriac, Dag Altin, Rolf Erik Olsen and Kasper Hancke, currently in review in PLOS ONE. A preprint of the article is available at [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.06.523004v1).

Datasets:<br>
* cop_data_final: Overview of copepod samples from all experiments, with stage and preservation method. <br>
* particles_compare_final: Particle concentration in the <5 ??m (SMALL) and 5-40 ??m (LARGE) size range, total volume of particles and mean particle size in the 5-40 ??m size range, measured from the different experimental bottles before and after each feeding experiment.<br>
* fecal_data_final: Number of fecal pellets counted during a 5 min. time interval from the different experimental bottles after each feeding experiment.<br>
* qpcr_lam_final: Number of fecal pellets counted during a 5 min. time interval from the different experimental bottles after each feeding experiment.<br>
* qpcr_lam_final: Estimated *Laminaria hyperborea* DNA concentration (ng DNA/??l) extracted from copepods from different food treatments, compared to blanks (no sample material) and samples extracted from sedated copepods that were submerged in the kelp material for 1 min and then rinsed.<br>
* qpcr_sac_final: Estimated *Saccharina latissima* DNA concentration (ng DNA/??l) extracted from copepods from different food treatments, compared to blanks (no sample material) and samples extracted from sedated copepods that were submerged in the kelp material for 1 min and then rinsed.<br>
